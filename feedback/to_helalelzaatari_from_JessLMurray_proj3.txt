	Your readme provides a solid overview of what you plan to do with the data, and sounds like it is focused on helping our client, UMD. I believe your second sentence is a fragment - "For example, whether people with a certain disability tend to stay longer than those with no disability or some other disability" should instead say something like "For example, I plan to investigate whether people with a certain disability tend to stay longer than those with no disability or some other disability."
	You have also included some code for wrangling your data both in Python and R - this meets the criteria for the project, and it looks like you've done some necessary cleaning with regards to the dates of service for UMD. Well done! I also like your ideas for plotting the distribution of demographic variables such as length of stay, age, and gender - these should be really useful for UMD! Overall, I think your project shows promise and I'm curious to see the final result.
