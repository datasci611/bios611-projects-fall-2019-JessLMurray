## Urban Ministries of Durham Data Set

This project is focused on analysis of services provided by the non-profit organization Urban Ministries of Durham (UMD) to the homeless population of Durham county, North Carolina. Data were collected from ~1991 to the present, and include information on goods such as food, clothing, bus tickets, diapers, school supplies, hygiene kits, and financial support provided to clients. Individual clients and families are uniquely identified by a file number and the date of service. Information provided by UMD on variables in the data set are given below:

| Variable | Description |

| Client File Number | Family identifier (individual or family) |
| Client File Merge | Separate files were created for one family then merged later |
| Bus Tickets (Number of) | Service discontinued |
| Notes of Service |  |
| Food Provided for | Number of people in the family for which food was provided |
| Food Pounds | Number of pounds of food that each individual or family received when shopping at UMD food pantry |
| Clothing Items | Number of clothing items received per family or individual |
| Diapers | Number of packs of diapers received (individuals/families are given 2 packs of diapers per child, and packs contain 22 diapers on average) |
| School Kits |  |
| Hygiene Kits | Number of kits received per individual or family. Kits contain soap, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, deodorant, a toothbrush, toothpaste, a washcloth, a disposable razor, and a bottle of shaving cream. |

## Urban Ministries of Durham Data Analysis

For the first draft, this analysis will focus on answering the following questions: 
* How many clients/families use services provided by UMD?
* Which services are provided most frequently?
* Are there any long-term trends (i.e. from the beginning of data collection to the present) in the quantity of services provided? 


The final draft will also (hopefully) include analyses which answer the following questions: 
* For clients who received aid from UMD on more than one occassion, what is the average time interval between services?
* Are seasonal trends present in the data (i.e. are certain services provided more frequently during specific times of the year?)
