## UMD Shiny Dashboard 

While project one focused on descriptive statistics for the data set, project two will focus more on identifying and harnessing trends to allow UMD to anticipate the needs of the community. This analysis will focus on whether economic data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics can be used to predict the number of clients who will visit UMD (data availabile at https://www.bls.gov/charts/employment-situation/civilian-unemployment-rate.htm).

For more information on the services provided by UMD to the Durham county community, visit http://www.umdurham.org/.
