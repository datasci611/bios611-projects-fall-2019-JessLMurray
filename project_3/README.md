## Urban Ministries of Durham Data Background

The objective of this project is to analyze the goods and services provided by the non-profit organization Urban Ministries of Durham (UMD) to the homeless population of Durham county, North Carolina. Individual clients and families are identified by a file number and the date of service. Information provided by UMD is given below:

| Data Set | Description |
|:---------|:-----------|
| Client | information on client age, gender, race, ethnicity, and veteran status |
| Disable_Entry, Disable_Exit, and Disable_Reviews | information re. disability type & status at time of entry and exit from UMD services |
| EE_Reviews, EE_UDES, Entry_Exit | information re. entry and exit interviews conducted with clients, including housing status and history, domestic violence history, length of stay, and reason(s) for leaving UMD |
| Health_Ins Entry, Health_Ins Exit | health insurance type and coverage status for clients at time of entry and exit from UMD services |
| Income Entry, Income Exit, Noncash Entry, Noncash Exit | information re. cash and non-cash sources of income for UMD clients at time of entry and exit from UMD services |
| Provider | service location and ID for UMD |
| SPDAT_Fam, SPDAT_Indiv, SPDAT_V1 | Survey responses for different variants of the Service Prioritization Decision Assistance Tool (SPDAT) |

## UMD Data Analysis 

This project will focus on the influence of social determinants of health on the extent of services needed. My research questions are: 
* What are the clients' demographics (e.g. race, age, gender, etc.)? 
* What is the distribution of prior living situations among clients of UMD?
* Is there a relationship between cash and non-cash income and the length of stay at UMD? If so, which forms of income are associated with the shortest length of stay?
