Thank you for your note regarding your progress! This gave me a bit more context to provide feedback. 
You readme is easy to follow and succinct with a list of data sets to be used. I think it describes everything you need without getting too technical for the average reader. Nice job! Depending on who will look at your project, it may be helpful to have a couple of sentences describing UMD itself and what UMD stands for. I also like your summary html document for the descriptive statistics of the client data set - it was easy to follow, and the variables investigated should be valuable for those at UMD. You have also organized your document very well with headings that describe your objectives. Try rotating your x-axis titles with ggplot so that categorical variables are fully visible in your bar charts - you can use something along the lines of the following: theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 65, hjust = 1)). Also, I believe there is a typo in your final header - "The" is spelled as "Tbe". Overall, I think your work is very promising and I'm interested to see your conclusions!
