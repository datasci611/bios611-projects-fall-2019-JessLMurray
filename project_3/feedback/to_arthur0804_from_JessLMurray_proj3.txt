Your readme includes a good description of the background on UMD for those who are new to the project, and a brief description of the datasets you are using - nice job! Be sure to fill in your research question once you have finished your rough draft, since this will be important for your final grade and for the reader. 
Your html document is clean, easy to read, and has very attractive figures - well done! You have a typo in your Section 1 header; it should read as "Demographic" instead of "Deomographic". I really like your stacked graph showing the distribution of race by gender; it effectively conveys a lot of information in a single figure. I am very excited to see the results of your Chi-squared analysis! I think this information will be very useful for UMD with some added interpretation/discussion of your results. Overall, I think your analysis is very promising and I can't wait to see your final draft!
